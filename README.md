# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

Udacity Professional Data Analysis Nanodegree - Project #1

## Overview
___
In this project, I will explore data of bike share systems for 3 cities in USA : New York City - Washington - Chicago. I wrote a code to import the data and answer some questions in python. I used Pycharm as my IDE. I also wrote a script to take the raw input to create an interactive experience for the user in terminal to present some statistics.

## Dataset
The datasets are for a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first 6 months of 2017 for three cities. The files for the three cities contain:

Start Time
End Time
Trip Duration
Start Station
End Station

### The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
